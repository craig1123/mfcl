# Typography

```javascript
import Typography from 'mfcl/Typography'
```

## Description

Wrap text in the Typography component and give it a variant for the correct style and tags. Custom tags
can also be passed to the component.

## Properties

<Props of={Typography} />

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <Component>
    <Typography variant="h1">h1 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h2">h2 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h3">h3 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h4">h4 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h5">h5 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6">h6 - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="paragraph-lg">paragraph-lg - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="paragraph">paragraph - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="paragraph-sm">paragraph-sm - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="price-lg">price-lg - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="price-sale">price-sale - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="price">price - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="eyebrow">eyebrow - Hello World</Typography>
    <Typography variant="byline">byline - Hello World</Typography>
  </Component>
</Playground>

### Pass a Custom Tag to the Component

You may want the h1 variant, but you already have an h1 on the page,
so you're able to pass a tag with the tag prop.

- For example, turn an h2 variant into a p tag.

<Playground>
  <Typography variant="h2" tag="p">
    This is the h2 variant but rendered as a p tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="price-sale" tag="a" href="/">
    This is the price-sale variant but rendered as an a tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" tag="h3" className="veryGreen" style={{ color: 'green' }}>
    This is the paragraph-lg variant but rendered as an h3 tag instead! Also with a custom className and styling.
  </Typography>
</Playground>

### Align the text with the align prop

<Playground>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" align="left">
    I'm left aligned! This is the default alignment.
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" align="center">
    I'm center aligned!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" align="right">
    I'm right aligned!
  </Typography>
</Playground>

### The noWrap Prop

You can pass the noWrap prop and the text will not wrap and instead truncate with a text overflow ellipsis.

<Playground>
  <div style={{ width: '15%' }}>
    <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" noWrap>
      This is what it's like to have noWrap on
    </Typography>
  </div>
</Playground>

### Set the color of the text

<Playground>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" color="primary">
    The default text color is primary
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" color="secondary">
    The is the secondary color
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" color="success">
    The is the success color
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" color="alert">
    This is the alert color
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="paragraph-lg" color="error">
    This is the error color
  </Typography>
</Playground>
